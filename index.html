                      After working in the IT Support sector for several years, I discovered my aptitude for software engineering and solutions design.
                      Having completed a Bachelor of Computer Science I am now working in game development as a research assistant for the University of Melbourne.
                      My strengths include problem solving, solutions design, agile software development, technical and design documentation,
                      interpersonal communication, and quality assurance.</br></br>

                      I am highly self-motivated, an effective team player and enjoy the satisfaction of constructing a solution
                      to a difficult challenge.
